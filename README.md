# JsonToKeyValuePairs

Generally JSON is converted to & from definite objects. But I had a requirement where we wished to load json into an array/list where data will be stored in key/value pairs.

I could not find any readymade solution So I created this one.

I hope it may be useful to others too.

Thank you.
